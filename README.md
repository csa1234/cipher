# Cipher

Welcome to the Cipher repository! This readme provides an overview of the code and explains how to use the cipher library.

## Cipher Description

The `cipher` folder contains code related to cryptographic algorithms and functions. Here's a brief description of what you'll find in this repository:

- The code provides implementations of various encryption and decryption algorithms, such as symmetric ciphers (e.g., AES, DES) and asymmetric ciphers (e.g., RSA, ECC).
- It includes functions for encrypting and decrypting data using these algorithms, as well as other cryptographic operations like hashing and digital signatures.
- The code may also include additional helper functions or utilities specific to your use case.

## Usage
